# Side Panel Fix Documentation

## Issue
The extension was failing to open the side panel with the error:
```
Failed to open side panel: Error: `sidePanel.open()` may only be called in response to a user gesture.
```

## Root Cause
The original implementation was trying to programmatically open the side panel using `chrome.sidePanel.open()` in response to an action click, but this API call requires a direct user gesture context and cannot be called from a background script's action click handler.

## Solution
The fix involved switching from programmatic side panel opening to Chrome's native side panel behavior configuration:

### 1. Background Script Changes (`background.js`)
**Before:**
```javascript
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
    await chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId }); // This fails!
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    // Enable side panel to open when action icon is clicked
    chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })
        .then(() => {
            console.log("Side panel behavior set: openPanelOnActionClick = true");
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error("Failed to set side panel behavior:", error);
        });
});
```

### 2. Manifest Configuration
The manifest.json already had the correct configuration:
```json
{
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Open Pontix Side Panel"
  },
  "side_panel": {
    "default_path": "html/sidebar.html"
  },
  "permissions": ["sidePanel"]
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Extension Installation**: When the extension is installed/updated, the background script calls `chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })`

2. **User Interaction**: When users click the extension icon in the toolbar, Chrome automatically opens the side panel

3. **Content Detection**: The content script continues to detect text selections and send them via storage-based messaging to the side panel

4. **Translation**: The side panel receives selections and displays them for translation

## Key Benefits

- **User Gesture Compliance**: No longer tries to programmatically open side panels outside user gesture context
- **Native UX**: Uses Chrome's built-in side panel behavior for consistent user experience  
- **Reliable Operation**: Eliminates the "user gesture" error completely
- **Automatic Injection**: Content scripts are automatically injected when needed

## Testing

1. Install the extension in Chrome
2. Click the Pontix icon in the toolbar → Side panel should open automatically
3. Select text on any webpage → Text should appear in the side panel
4. Configure translation providers and test translations

## Files Modified

- `src/scripts/background.js` - Implemented correct side panel behavior
- `src/manifest/manifest.json` - Ensured correct action configuration  
- Previous messaging fixes remain in place for content script → side panel communication

This fix resolves the core side panel opening issue while maintaining all the previous communication improvements.

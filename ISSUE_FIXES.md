# Issue Fixes Summary

## üöÄ Fixed Issues

### 1. ‚úÖ Database Sync Error: Missing 'theme' Column

**Problem**: `Settings sync failed: Could not find the 'theme' column of 'user_settings' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause**: The database schema was missing the `theme` column that the code was trying to save.

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Added `theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'system'` to the database schema in `docs/supabase_setup.md`
- ‚úÖ Created migration script for existing databases
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation to include theme column explanation
- ‚úÖ Added migration notice to build script

**For Existing Users**: Run this SQL command in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_settings ADD COLUMN theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'system';
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Text Selection Detection on Complex Sites

**Problem**: Extension not detecting selected text on sites like `read.amazon.com`

**Root Cause**: Complex sites (React apps, Amazon, etc.) use custom event handling that interferes with standard selection detection.

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Added enhanced selection detection for React-based sites
- ‚úÖ Added capture phase event listeners for better compatibility
- ‚úÖ Added fallback selection extraction methods
- ‚úÖ Added input/textarea selection support
- ‚úÖ Added special handling for Amazon and similar sites
- ‚úÖ Improved selection range extraction with multiple fallbacks

**Technical Changes**:
- Mouse/touch event listeners with capture phase
- Multiple selection extraction methods
- Site-specific detection (Amazon, React apps)
- Enhanced error handling and fallbacks

### 3. ‚úÖ Premature API Requests (Mouse Button Release)

**Problem**: Extension sending API requests before mouse button is released

**Root Cause**: The extension was processing selections immediately without waiting for the user to finish selecting.

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Added mouse state tracking (`isMouseDown`/`isMouseUp`)
- ‚úÖ Added 100ms delay after mouse release
- ‚úÖ Increased selection processing timeout from 200ms to 300ms
- ‚úÖ Increased translation debounce delay from 500ms to 800ms
- ‚úÖ Added proper mouse event handlers to track selection state

**Technical Changes**:
- `mousedown`/`mouseup` event tracking
- Selection processing blocked while mouse is down
- Progressive timeout increases for better UX
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## üîß How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Update Database (if you have existing data)
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE user_settings ADD COLUMN theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'system';
```

### Step 2: Update Extension
```bash
# Build the updated extension
npm run build

# Or run the test build
./test-build.sh
```

### Step 3: Reload Extension in Chrome
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the reload button on your extension
3. Test on different websites including Amazon

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Database Sync
1. Enable cloud sync in extension settings
2. Change theme setting
3. Save settings - should work without errors
4. Check Supabase dashboard for saved theme

### Test 2: Text Selection on Complex Sites
1. Go to `read.amazon.com` or any React-based site
2. Select text slowly and quickly
3. Text should appear in extension sidebar
4. Test with different selection methods (mouse, touch, keyboard)

### Test 3: Mouse Button Release
1. Select text by dragging mouse
2. Hold mouse button down for a moment
3. Release mouse button
4. API request should only fire after button release
5. Check console logs for timing messages
